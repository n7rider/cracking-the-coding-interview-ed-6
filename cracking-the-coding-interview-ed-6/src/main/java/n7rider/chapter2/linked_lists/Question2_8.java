 * Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the
 * beginning of the loop.
 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so
 * as to make a loop in the linked list.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input:
 * A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
 * Output:
 * C
 * Hints: #50, #69, #83, #90
