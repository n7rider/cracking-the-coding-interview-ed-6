/**
 * T9: On old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keypad and the phone would provide a list of
 * words that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set of O - 4 letters. Implement an algoÂ­
 * rithm to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid
 * words (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). The mapping is shown in the diagram below:
 *
 *       1         2          3
 *                abc        def
 *
 *       4         5          6
 *      ghi       jkl        mno
 *
 *       7         8          9
 *     pqrs       tuv       wxyz
