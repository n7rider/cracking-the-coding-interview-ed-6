/**
 * The Masseuse: A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests
 * and is debating which ones to accept. She needs a 15-minute break between appointments and
 * therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a sequence of back-to-back appointÂ­
 * ment requests (all multiples of 15 minutes, none overlap, and none can be moved), find the optimal
 * (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: {30, 15, 60, 75, 45, 15, 15, 45}
 * Output:180 minutes ({30, 60, 45, 45}).
