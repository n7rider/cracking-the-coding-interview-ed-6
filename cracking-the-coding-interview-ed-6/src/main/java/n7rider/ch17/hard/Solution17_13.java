/**
 * Re-Space: Oh, no! You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in a
 * lengthy document. A sentence like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!"
 * became "iresetthecomputeri tstilldidntboot''. You'll deal with the punctuation and capiÂ­
 * talization later; right now you need to re-insert the spaces. Most of the words are in a dictionary but
 * a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings) and the document (a string), design an algorithm
 * to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters.
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input:
 * jesslookedjustliketimherbrother
 * Output: jess looked just like tim her brother (7 unrecognized characters)
