/**
 * 5.8
 * Draw Line: A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
 * pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will
 * be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array
 * and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from ( xl, y) to ( x2, y).
 * The method signature should look something like:
 * drawline(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)
 * Hints: #366, #387, #384, #397
