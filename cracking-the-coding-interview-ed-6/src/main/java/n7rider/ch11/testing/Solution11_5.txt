/**
 * Test a Pen: How would you test a pen?
 */

Gather requirements about pen:
Type of pen - ball point | gel | space pen etc.
Pen color range - single | multi
Color - array of colors
Addition features - Glitter, with flavor
Body - Plastic | Aluminum | Titanium
Style - Looks, comfort (grips)
Accessories - Cap, ink remover, additional refills

Gather usage requirement:
Target users - Office | Students | Luxury | Extreme weather
Operating range - temperature | pressure | gravity (will it work if placed upside down and shaken) etc
Breaking point behavior - don't spill ink, no sharp objects inside etc.
Lifetime - How many metres can you draw

Gather use cases:
Writing,
transport environment and context,
Usage frequency per day
Usage duration per day

Testing tools
Robotic arm that can move up/down, left/write based on instructions and timer
Manual user checking
Environmental testing for drops, temperature

Testing:
- Test if 'pen requirements' are as expected?
    Test manually,
    Use a robotic eye for visual features
    Mount on robotic arm to test color, features

- Test 'usage requirements'
    Environmental testing
    Manually reach breaking point or use tools like hammer
    Keep running on robotic arm to check lifetime

- Test 'use cases'
    Keep running on robotic arm to check lifetime according to specs
    Feedback from manual testers


After checking solution:
I didn't add target use in usage requirement. That checks if it works on canvas, paper or wherever the pen is used.
