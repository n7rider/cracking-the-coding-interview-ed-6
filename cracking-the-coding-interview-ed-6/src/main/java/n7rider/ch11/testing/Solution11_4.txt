/**
 * No Test Tools: How would you load test a webpage without using any test tools?
 */

Simplest ways:
Keep refreshing the browser page
Open in different devices at the same time
Do curl command from a terminal

Complex ways:
Create an application (not a test tool, but it can be one)
Cause a breakpoint in JS code in browser
Test large values for all user input in the page

Peeked at the book solution, it goes about creating an application:

So, a load test application should have these configureable:
- No of users
- No of hits by the same user (like opening a page in different tabs but sharing the same cookies, session)
- No of seconds between each wave
- No of hits per wave
- Scaling up to find the breaking point
    - No of seconds between each wave, no of hits per wave
- Find recovery time
    - Time to recover for x% of the traffic after breaking point

Measure these traits while doing this:
- CPU load
- Memory load
- DB load
- Network load
- Response time for each layer
- Total hits
- Total time

From solution:
It talks about threads can simulate different real-world users loading a page. Yup!
