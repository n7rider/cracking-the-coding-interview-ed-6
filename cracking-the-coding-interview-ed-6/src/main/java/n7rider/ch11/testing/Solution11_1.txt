 * Mistake: Find the mistake(s) in the following code:
 * unsigned int i;
 * for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i)
 *    printf("%d\n", i);
 */

1. Unsigned int won't have a sign, so the loop won't run correctly. It will become 1 after 0.
2. Even if `unsigned` is removed, it'll run 101 times, and not 100 times.

After finishing:
- unsigned int is not available in Java, only in C, C++

After comparing:
- The book suggests using %u to print unsigned int
